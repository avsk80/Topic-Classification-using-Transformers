6,"if e.r.a. is the best possible way of measuring a pitcher's performance, why even keep track of wins?","there simply is no better indicator of a pitcher's performance than earned run average. no matter which way you look at it. wins, in my opinion, are a useless statistic (and outdated) because a pitcher has no control whatsoever of the performance of his hitters. conceivably, a pitcher could have an e.r.a. of 5.00 and have a record of 20 6. it all depends on what his offense produces for him. the best example ever might be clemens last year. he didn't rack up the wins but he was almost unstoppable on the mound with an e.r.a. under two. i am baffled that mlb still keeps track of wins. i guess it is simply for the entertainment of the fans or for fantasy league stats. what is your opinion on this subject?",en,en,en,en,en,en

(and play in the title if the beat arkansas) n nusc is a great team but lost to an unranked oregon state, and also they re schedule was not hard at all!! (compared to florida's) their toughest team they finally played was cal, and notre dame was overrated. also when the beat arkansas, when they were without mcfadden, who is their big playmaker and one of the league s best rushers. so they beat oregon when they were ranked, but so did oregon state who beat them! i guarantee if you put usc with florida s schedule, they would have at least 2 or 3 losses. the computer likes usc too much n nmichigan should not even be in the talks because they had their shot and they did not win how can they have a rematch when they did not even win their conference? n ngators and buckeyes in the title game is what it should be",en,en,en,en,en,en
