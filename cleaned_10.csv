10,do orwell s predictions ring true?,"do orwell s predictions ring true? n n nby derek shaw nthe daily trojan noctober 4, 2002 ngeorge orwell's 1984 depicts a world that has been reduced to absolute governmental control over all areas of life, banishing the freedom to love, read and even think freely. the threat of constant warfare falsely propagated by the party, the single political power in the totalitarian state of oceania, allows the government to maintain and expand its reign over the lives of its people. n nsound somewhat familiar? well it should n nas the likelihood of war in the middle east continues to escalate, american citizens are slowly and methodically being stripped of some of their most fundamental civil liberties. meanwhile, the u.s. government has successfully created an unprecedented fervor of patriotism, causing americans to blindly hand over their freedoms in exchange for the promise of security. n nwithout attempting to cast any unmerited aspersions on our government or immaturely parallel a piece of fiction to reality, it is nonetheless interesting and rather eerie to compare the events in 1984 to the affairs of today. n nlet's look at the facts. n nin 1984, the bold slogan of the party is war is peace. freedom is slavery. ignorance is strength. this set of socio political paradoxes serve to justify the actions of the government while forcing the population to abide by the imperishable laws. the assumed objective of protecting the nation rationalizes all violence and corruption. n nthe state of oceania in 1984 is involved in an eternal war with an unclear, ever shifting enemy. the government leads the public to n nbelieve that they are always in danger, when in fact n nmuch, if not all, of the war is fabricated. one day the enemy is eurasia, and the next day the government announces that the enemy is eastasia and has always been eastasia. the people swallow the lies and digest them as truths without raising a single question. the real purpose of war is to control opposition of the government and maintain total authority by cultivating fear and hatred. n ntoday we are facing imminent war with iraq. a year ago our target was al qaida and bin laden. then it became a battle within afghanistan. and just to be sure, president george w. bush openly labeled iran, north korea and iraq as the axis of evil. in a later speech, he added cuba, libya and syria to the growing list of nations that are allegedly seeking to obtain or develop weapons of mass destruction. n nindeed, the war on terrorism has spread out of control. on aug. 22, 2002, bush called saddam hussein a threat to the civilized world and announced that it was in everyone's best interest to see him removed from power. granted, hussein is not the first person on most of our christmas card mailing lists, but what has really happened in recent years to warrant such treatment? surely it is a mere coincidence that bush (former oil tycoon) is targeting iraq, which just so happens to have one of the most plentiful petroleum supplies in the world. n nin many ways, bush has become the physical manifestation of big brother, the omnipotent, all knowing symbol of leadership in oceania. in 1984, big brother is both feared and loved by the people. his power goes untested. similarly, the bush administration has sculpted an infallible image of integrity for itself, and the american people have responded with a show of faith and support. in fact, it has become accepted, if not fashionable, to show american pride with stickers, t shirts and flags. a frenzy of nationalism has infected our country and consequently we have put trust in the government to do all that is necessary to defend and vindicate the united states. n nas a result, american freedoms are being cleverly attacked by new legislation, which is taking advantage of the vulnerability of its citizens. in 1984, signs re",en,en,en,en,en,en

(at polling place) n n3) per law when a new voter is registering for the first time and if they do not have the official identification required by their state then the state must provide the option of none on the registration form to use as identification and they must then accept the undocumented applicant as a registered us voter. n nbut 3 supercedes 1 as long as you are registering as a new voter for the first time. and it is only applicable under the conditions of being a first timer. n nyou and i could not use the none provision as we are already registered legal voters. n nonce you use the none provision you automatically receive a voter registration card and your state issues you an official voter number to identify you and then you have successfully bypassed the required id to verify citizenship at this point. n nnow comes the worst part : n nthis official went on to tell me that illegals are registering, but not with intent to vote (yet) what they are doing with their registered us voter number is putting the voter registration number onto an i 9 form and that is then legal accepted government proof of citizenship ! n nonce registered if they did want to vote they can, here is how under this loophole : n nonce you have your voter registration card with voter number in hand you must vote in person. at that time you must bring your identification with you to vote, but since you registered under the none provision you are allowed to use a non government and non official id n nunder federal law each state can decide which non official id to accept at the time of voting if you registered under the none provision, but because of the 2 statement above it can only be used to verify a match of the name on your voter registration card at time of voting, it can not be used to verify citizenship. n nfor example : fl accepts a sam's club card (among other things) but not a utility bill, however il accepts a utility bill (among other things) but not a sam's club card. n nthe federal law requires each state to accept one of several non official id's, but each state can pick which and how many to choose from. n nmany states do not even require you list or supply which non official id you will use to register, all you have to do is mark none in those states n nthe trouble is these non official non government id's can be made by any 6th grader on their home computer. n nso, you can see it is not just hava, they added one thing to this bill, another thing to that bill, and as the paralegal said the only way to find the true complete scope of this whole mess is to read all of your states election and voter registration bills. n nnow, why only 49 and not 50 states n narizona is the one state that doesn't have the loopholes because the public caught wind of it early enough to write and vote on a referendum requiring real and solid",en,en,en,en,en,en
