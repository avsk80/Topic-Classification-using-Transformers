The infomation from the camera is analyzed by a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect imperfections in the underlying surface and determine motion. Some materials, such as glass, mirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces interfere with the ability of the DSP to accurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse.  \\nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the mouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in the underlying surface to determine motion.  Mirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they constantly reflect back the same image, causing the DSP not to recognize motion properly. When the system is unable to see surface changes associated with movement, the mouse will not work properly.\n","5\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["4     Computers & Internet\n","Name: class_category, dtype: object"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df = df.drop(['best_answer'], axis=1)\n","df.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"i787wUa-aEah","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1680300306649,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":270,"user":{"displayName":"Venkata Sai Krishna Abbaraju","userId":"03956108207244612420"}},"outputId":"6cf0c3bd-03d1-438c-8237-c9d8da3db52f"},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   class_index                                     question_title  \\\n","0            5  why doesn't an optical mouse work on a glass t...   \n","1            6       What is the best off-road motorcycle trail ?   \n","2            3             What is Trans Fat?
