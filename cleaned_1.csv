1,i have tried to understand all religions and stoped believing in any religion.read on hinduism .am i mad?,"hinduism is based principally on four vedas . these four books of hinduism cover every aspect of leading ones life. these books are in sanskrit. nvedic hymens are chanted in all the hindu rituals from marriage as well as cremation.based on these books hinduism is a way of life. nin these four vedas there is no scope for worshiping of a deity. ngod is formless and one but for concentration of mind deity worship was introduced later.god is all pervading is the common belief of hinduism.hence what ever you choose can be assumed to project image of god. nthere as they say are 330 million gods and goddesses in hinduism. it reflects that god is all pervading and exists every where. there is nothing which does not have soul and spiritual content.this is the highest fundamental commonality which makes hinduism so open and accepting. nthe highest form of understanding god or brahma is when in very deep meditation, after the mind is completely shed in shav asana( state of dead body,which is the last stage in yoga achievement,rishis like shankracharya and many others experienced one ness with god.they suddenly realized and without words felt 'aham brahma asti' meaning there by' i am god'.they were able to get dissolved while living and feel part of the whole universe. nthis comes with greatest possible renunciation and yoga practice after the physical aspect is fully tamed. nhence for these rishis or gurus every thing relected and reminded the existance of god. nthe vastness of hinduiism was slowly misused and lesser values like idle worship where a common man found some mode of concentration ,were introduced. nkrishna too was a hindu scholar. nwhen he says in gita that i am god is because of this basic vedic philosophy.aham braham asti.people started worshipping him as god. ngita is nothing but concentrated form of vedic philsophy. nkrishna learnt about vedas in a religious school when he was young.it is very confusing for many like you when they see so many forms of gods etc.you will find snakes,elephans,birds,etc.etc being worshipped as gods.this is hinduism which absorbs every aspect of life but has a common ground to stand on. ni go one step furhter then this and say look into the soul of this planet and see what i see.i say with clarity that my realization goes beyond vedas. every religion has lived its life and become a political game.like yoga is physical and mental achievement without seeking one ness with god.incase you wantany clarification contact me on, . ni have no religious affliations or any cult.i am all by myself. nsource(s): n nhandfull of dust particles provides me deepest source of meditation on god of reality in the cosmos.i have found none who can realy understand me.i have written about 20,000 pages but feel it will all go waste.",en,en,en,en,en,en

1,for christian only please?,i have been doing some reading and soul searching of late and i am confused. the ten commandments say 1.i am a jealous god and you shall have no other gods before me (basically). jesus says that only through him can i get to god and heaven. questions: is jesus speaking figuritively or do i really have to use his name in my prayers? does bringing jesus s name into my prayers and including jesus along with god almighty break the first commandment? i have always been of the opinion that i should only pray to god and give him all my heart. to bring in the names of saints or even jesus seems to go against the 1st commandment. but from what i have been reading it seems i may be making a mistake. god is everything to me and this is troubling me as i wish to do things right and not dishonor god or jesus. please read this carefully and answer all the questions as clearly and plainly as possible. this is very important to me. thanks for your time in advance and peace to you all.,en,en,en,en,en,en

(not to mention that the idea of conflict in and of itself implies error.) n nthere are tons of examples likes this. (for more examples, see thomas paine's age of reason ) how does a christian rationalize the existence of such errors? is it simply a case of willful ignorance, or is there some mechanism that allows them to abstract the parts they believe are god's word and ignore the rest or interpret it less literally?",en,en,en,en,en,en

1,don't you know you get god all riled up angry when you forbid women to breast feed in public?,"published apr 6, 2006 n nbreast feeding rights bill clears senate, ready for sanford to sign nseanna adcox, associated press n ncolumbia south carolina mothers can soon breast feed their babies in public without fear of being ordered into a dark corner or dirty public bathroom. n na bill that allows mothers to breast feed anywhere they have the right to be and exempts breast feeding from indecent exposure laws cleared the senate on wednesday. the house approved the measure in february. n ngov. mark sanford has not committed to signing it. his spokesman joel sawyer said the governor sees nothing wrong with the bill so far, but he wants to review it further when it hits his desk. n n we're 10 inches from the goal line. it's been a fairly long battle, said rep. chip limehouse, r charleston, the bill's chief sponsor. n nlimehouse introduced the bill after an incident last summer at a victoria's secret lingerie store in mount pleasant. lori rueger said a store clerk told her she could not breast feed her 10 week old daughter in a dressing room and encouraged her to use a public restroom in another store instead, a setting nursing moms call unsanitary and uncomfortable. the incident prompted protests and made national news. n nlimehouse said he first proposed a breast feeding rights bill in 1997, but it went nowhere. the subject was almost ticklish. legislators didn't know how to deal with it, he said. n nalmost a decade later, lawmakers were piling on to support it, limestone said. n nthirty nine states have already passed laws related to breast feeding. of those, 32 states, including georgia and north carolina, allow mothers to breast feed in any public or private location. n nkansas became no. 32 last month when gov. kathleen sebelius signed legislation. bills are awaiting governors' signatures in kentucky and mississippi. n n what a great day for breast feeding moms, said dr. lewis gregory, chief medical officer for select health of south carolina. we support the rights of women to feed their children whenever and wherever they need to be. n nto encourage women to breast feed, his company will offer expectant mothers covered by select health free breast pumps beginning may 1. n nstudies show breast feeding improves the health of both the baby and mother. they also show that breast feeding babies reduces their risk of becoming obese later, helps mothers return to a pre pregnancy weight and improves a child's immunity system and aids their development n nsouth carolina ranks near the bottom nationwide in percentage of mothers who breast feed. lawmakers hope the approved bill will improve the state's numbers. n n this is step one in getting south carolina where it needs to be, said rep. catherine ceips, r beaufort, who also sponsored the bill.",en,en,en,en,en,en
