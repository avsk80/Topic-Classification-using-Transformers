attempts needed to boot up laptop?\n","hi everyone. i'm having troubles w my sony vaio s150. it was overheating and i opened it and took out the heatsink to clean up the dust. it also seemed to have problem w the hard disk that i had to tilt the laptop to a certain angle to keep the windows running and if i lay it flat on desk it freezed. so i have also replaced the hard disk. nthe problem i've been having before after i replaced the hard disk is that i have to keep turning the laptop on and off multiple times (sometimes more than 30 times) just to boot into windows. i powers up but screen shows nothing and the fan is very quiet. no beeps or anything. turn it off and turn it on again and repeat very annoying nwhat could be the cause of this and how can i narrow down the possibilities? could it be the heatsink that i took out and put back causing it not sitting tight and flat on the cpu? please tell me that it's not the expensive motherboard nthank you all in advance !!\n","i need
