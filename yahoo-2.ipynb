Well I would ask the opposite question, how can God not exist in light of the evil and suffering.  The existence of God gives an explanation for where we get morality and absolute truth, and goodness and evil.  If there isn't a God to define good and bad for us, then everything is arbritary.  You cannot tell me I can't do x and y, because its wrong.  Why is it wrong?  Why do you get to decide?  What's right for you might not be right for me...and the relativism begins to spiral out of control.  Where else do we get a conscience from, and where do we get the ideals to strive for from?  How can general morality be so similar across the world and cross-culturally?  How can  we define evil, unless we get it from an outside source?  The answer to the question \"Why does a good God allow evil and suffering to happen?\" is another can of worms.  But as a starting point, you shouldn't use evil as an excuse to doubt God.\n","people ask,  how can god exist in light of all the evil and suffering? .  well i would ask the opposite question, how can god not exist in light of the evil and suffering.  the existence of god gives an explanation for where we get morality and absolute truth, and goodness and evil.  if there isn't a god to define good and bad for us, then everything is arbritary.  you cannot tell me i can't do x and y, because its wrong.  why is it wrong?  why do you get to decide?  what's right for you might not be right for meand the relativism begins to spiral out of control.  where else do we get a conscience from, and where do we get the ideals to strive for from?  how can general morality be so similar across the world and cross culturally?  how can  we define evil, unless we get it from an outside source?  the answer to the question  why does a good god allow evil and suffering to happen?  is another can of worms.  but as a starting point, you shouldn't use evil as an excuse to doubt god.\n","Seriously, it's way more fun than being serious.

Heavily pregnant she was hanging from my bedroom window ledge on the second floor. Pussah was trying to get in through the open louvre window to find a warm place to give birth, she was too round to get in but could not let go as the drop was too far so she was crying for help just hanging on by her claws. I had to remove a louvre panel to haul her through. Pussah gave birth to five kittens that night beside the piano in a comfy warm cardboard box, we found homes for them but kept Pussah and one kitten and they became much loved family members for about 10 years. We moved after Pussah died and her kitten now a big adult cat got to stay on with the new owner as she wouldn't settle in our new place and missed her garden territory to much,  we visited a couple time before she too died.
